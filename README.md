# StoryU
StoryU is an Android Kotlin project developed as part of the Dicoding Intermediate course submission. It follows the MVVM architecture pattern and utilizes dependency injection with Koin. The app interacts with a server endpoint provided by Dicoding.

## Features
1. Add Story: Users can create and add their own stories to the app.
2. Google Maps Integration: Stories with location information are displayed on a map with markers.
3. Paging3 with Remote Mediator: The app uses Paging3 to display a LiveData stream of stories, fetching data from the server in a paginated manner.
4. Testing for Paging3: Unit tests are implemented to verify the functionality of Paging3.
